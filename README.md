# React Weather App


## Getting started

- Sign up over at [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/appid) to get an API key.
- Fork the project and clone it locally.
- Create a file at the root of the project called `.env` with the following contents:

```sh
REACT_APP_APP_ID = The API key you obtained from openweathermap.org
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
